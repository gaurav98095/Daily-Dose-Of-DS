## Context Engineering

### Defination

* **Context engineering** is the **systematic design of inputs (context)** that an AI model receives to complete a task effectively.
* It goes beyond just writing clever prompts — it’s about **orchestrating the right data, tools, and format** dynamically.

###  Why is it Crucial Now?

* Most LLM-based apps fail not because the model is weak, but because the **context is incomplete or irrelevant**.
* In setups like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), success depends **80% on retrieval**, only **20% on generation**.

  * ✅ Good retrieval + weak LLM → Still works.
  * ❌ Bad retrieval + strong LLM → Always fails.

###  LLMs Are Not Mind Readers

* LLMs only understand and generate based on what **you explicitly give them**.
* They **can’t infer missing context** — you need to **engineer that context up front**.

###  Context Engineering Involves:

* Providing the **right information** (documents, user history, etc.)
* Giving access to the **right tools** (calculators, APIs, plugins)
* Structuring it in the **right format** (schemas, memory, system messages)

###  Why Prompt Engineering Alone Isn't Enough

* Prompt engineering relies on **clever phrasing** or "magic words".
* As tasks get more complex, **structured and relevant context** becomes more important than just better wording.


> *Context engineering is the foundation of reliable AI systems. Without the right context, even the best models fail.*

### 4 Components of Context Engineering

1. **Dynamic Information Flow**

   * Fetch and inject the **right data at the right time** (e.g., user history, documents, recent inputs).
   * Enables context-aware, adaptive responses based on real-time needs.

2. **Smart Tool Access**

   * Connect LLMs to **external tools/APIs** like calculators, search, CRMs, databases, etc.
   * The LLM becomes a **controller**, deciding *when* and *how* to use tools to complete a task.

3. **Memory Management**

   * Maintain relevant **short-term and long-term memory** (e.g., session memory, user preferences).
   * Prevents redundancy and enables **personalization** over time.

4. **Format Optimization**

   * Structure inputs in the **most effective format** (JSON, markdown, schemas, structured tables).
   * Reduces ambiguity and helps the model focus on **what matters most**.



## Run Classical ML Models 40x Faster on GPUs with Hummingbird

Hummingbird enables you to convert traditional ML models (like `sklearn`'s Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.) into tensor-based models. This lets you leverage hardware accelerators like GPUs for faster inference without sacrificing accuracy.

In some cases, inference speed improves by **40x** compared to CPU-based execution.

### Features

* Supports `scikit-learn`, `LightGBM`, and `XGBoost` models.
* Compiles models to PyTorch or TVM backends.
* Seamlessly runs on GPUs or CPUs.
* Maintains original model accuracy.

### Installation

```bash
pip install hummingbird-ml
```

### Example: Random Forest on GPU

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from hummingbird.ml import convert

# Generate dummy data
X = np.random.rand(10000, 28)
y = np.random.randint(2, size=10000)

# Train a traditional model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X, y)

# Convert to a PyTorch model (can use 'cuda' for GPU)
hb_model = convert(model, 'torch', device='cuda')

# Run inference on GPU
X_test = np.random.rand(1000, 28)
predictions = hb_model.predict(X_test)
```

### Performance Comparison

* On GPU, inference can be **up to 40x faster**.
* Accuracy remains equivalent to the original model.

### Supported Models

* `DecisionTreeClassifier` / `Regressor`
* `RandomForestClassifier` / `Regressor`
* `GradientBoostingClassifier`
* `XGBoost` and `LightGBM` trees
