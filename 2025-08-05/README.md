# Make RAG Systems 32x Memory Efficient with Binary Quantization

## Why Binary Quantization?

* Traditional RAG systems store embeddings in `float32` format, which is memory-heavy.
* **Binary Quantization** converts these embeddings to binary vectors, reducing memory usage by **\~32x** without a significant drop in accuracy.
* This approach is used by:

  * Perplexity (search index)
  * Azure (search pipeline)
  * HubSpot (AI assistant)

## What We'll Build

* A RAG system that:

  * Queries **36M+ vectors in <30ms**
  * Generates a response in **<1s**
* Tech stack:

  * **LlamaIndex** – orchestration (open-source)
  * **Milvus** – vector DB (open-source)
  * **Beam Cloud** – serverless deployment (open-source)
  * **Kimi-K2 (Groq)** – LLM inference (hosted)



## Workflow

### 1️⃣ Setup Groq

* Store Groq API key in `.env` file
* Load it into your environment for ultra-fast inference.

### 2️⃣ Load Data

* Ingest documents using **LlamaIndex Directory Reader**.
* Supports:

  * Markdown, PDFs, Word, PowerPoint
  * Images, audio, video

### 3️⃣ Generate Binary Embeddings

* Convert `float32` embeddings → **binary vectors**.
* Achieve **32x reduction in memory/storage**.
* This process is **Binary Quantization**.

### 4️⃣ Vector Indexing (Milvus)

* Store and index binary embeddings in Milvus.
* Use specialized data structures for high-speed retrieval.

### 5️⃣ Retrieval

* Embed user query → Apply binary quantization.
* Compare using **Hamming Distance**.
* Retrieve top-5 similar chunks and add to context.

### 6️⃣ Generation

* Build a prompt with query + retrieved chunks.
* Use **Kimi-K2 (Groq)** for ultra-fast generation.

### 7️⃣ Deployment with Beam

* Package workflow with **Streamlit interface**.
* Specify dependencies and compute requirements.
* Deploy with **Beam** for serverless hosting.

### 8️⃣ Run the App

* Beam launches container.
* Access Streamlit app via HTTPS.
* Test on **PubMed dataset (36M+ vectors):**

  * Retrieval: **<30ms**
  * Generation: **<1s**

✅ You now have a memory-efficient, production-grade RAG pipeline.


# Test-Time Data Augmentation (TTA)

## What is TTA?

* **Train-time augmentation**: Create new samples by transforming training data (e.g., image rotation).
* **Test-time augmentation (TTA)**: Apply augmentation during inference to create multiple variations of the test sample.



## How it Works

1. Input test example → Generate multiple augmented versions.
2. Model predicts for each version.
3. Aggregate predictions (average/vote).
4. Output a **more robust final prediction**.



## Why Use TTA?

✅ Benefits:

* Improves prediction accuracy.
* Reduces model error (the average error with TTA ≤ original model error).
* No need to retrain the model.

⚠️ Trade-offs:

* Increased inference time.

  * Data augmentation → extra processing.
  * Multiple predictions → longer runtime.



## When to Use TTA

* When accuracy matters more than speed.
* Ideal for:

  * Image classification
  * NLP inference (paraphrasing)
  * Tabular data with augmentable features

Avoid TTA if:

* Low latency is critical (e.g., real-time systems).
